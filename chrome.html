                <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong> is a free web browser developed by Google. It was first released in 2008, on Microsoft Windows, but was later ported to other platforms. Chrome itself is based on the open-source Chromium project. Google adds it's own proprietary features on top of the Chromium browser, which is then shipped as Google Chrome.</p>
