                <p><strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> is a proprietary web browser developed by Microsoft. It succeeds the earlier Microsoft Internet Explorer browser, which was released in 1995. Edge was developed with the intent of being a lightweight browser that focuses on compliance with web standards. The layout engine used in Edge is a heavily modified version of the one used in Internet Explorer, but with much of the legacy code removed.</p>
