            <p>A <strong>web browser</strong> is a piece of software that is used to access, retrieve, and present
                information that is stored on the World Wide Web. The data that is retrieved can come in various forms,
                such as: text, image files, or videos. While web browsers are mainly used for content on the World Wide
                Web, they can also be used to access information on servers, or even file systems. Modern browsers have
                features such as: tabbed browsing, bookmarks management, password management, private browsing, data
                syncing, and more. Extensions can also be downloaded to add additional functionality to a browser. Click
